### Q Tell us a little bit about yourself in your file.

Ans. My name is Vaibhav Bajaj and I am a sophomore at the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi in the Computer Science and Engineering branch. I like CyberSecurity, reading novels, playing keyboard, watching anime (I am a big otaku xD), etc.

Nice to meet you all!
